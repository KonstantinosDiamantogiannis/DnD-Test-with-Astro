author: Tacitus of Morinum 
title: Tacitus’ Spellbook “The Heart of All Flame”
excerpt: Bound in the crimson, scaled leather of some indeterminate reptilian beast, this large locked tome bears its title proudly in Common across the front cover. Inside is found not just spells but a lovingly written treatise on the beauty and purity of flame and how ice, when it grows cold enough, also burns.
