## Preparation Rituals:

Efficient Creator (Su) You can spend this boon to use the magic item creation rules to create items with the Craft skill for one day. When doing this, your material costs are equal to half the final value of the item crafted (rather than the normal 1/3 of the cost for using the Craft skill). You can craft items with a cost greater than 1,000 gp by expending this boon over successive days, in the same way magic items with a cost over 1,000 gp can be crafted over multiple days. You otherwise follow all the rules and options for magic item creations.


## THE PACT OF THORNS         
## 5th Personal LOYALTY ADDED by Salathil Luperius Rullus to the Ninth.

Behold, on this day the 13th of Kuthona, in the year 4724 Absalom Reckoning,
a perpetual Compact is made between Cardinal Adrastus Thorn (hereafter the Master),
and Salathil Luperius Rullus, who binds himself by will, by fire, and by blood.


**The Fifth Loyalty – The Loyalty of the Unbowed**

The Fifth Loyalty is to the iron spine of the Bound—their refusal to kneel before any false authority, tyrant, or so-called righteous power that dares demand surrender.

Let it be known: the Bound shall never bow, never yield, and never surrender—not to kings, not to saints, not to gods who would unmake their will.

To do so is to break the Contract.

To do so is to invite unmaking at the hands of Salathil Luperius Rullus, rightful Voice of Nethys and Flame of the Bound, whose wrath shall not wait for Hell’s approval.

"If one among us dares bend the knee to weakness, I shall rise—not as brother, not as judge—but as executioner.
Let the traitor be ash before they touch the ground."

This Fifth Loyalty shall never override the First, Second, or Third, but shall walk beside the Fourth as a pillar of strength and defiance.

"By pride unbroken, I swear it."

-Salathil, Arch-Adept of Nethys, Flame of the Horn and Paragon of the Arcane.
